A Thunderbird add-on to help with bugmail

Development
=============

To test the development version in thunderbird:

- uninstall „normal” Bugmail if it is installed (using Thunderbird Add-ons Manager), 
  restart Thunderbird so it acknowledges uninstall

- in your extensions directory 
  (~/.thunderbird/<Profile Name>/extensions/ or similar)
  create the file named 
      {32d96adf-23fc-403d-a1c8-e5cf6a019bee}
  (yes, use this ugly name, it must match <em:id> from install.rdf)
  which body is 
      /path/to/the/devel/bugmail/
  (replace with true full path to the directory this file lies in)

- restart thunderbird again.

Some useful development tricks:

- set javascript.options.showInConsole = true in about:config

- set extensions.logging.enabled = true

- start thunderbird with 

    thunderbird --purgecaches

Packaging
=============

Simply zip the whole extension folder, for example

    cd path/to/bugmail
    zip -r ../bugmail.xpi chrome/ chrome.manifest install.rdf LICENSE README
